Starting from scratch, here’s a detailed guide on how to complete your assignment step-by-step. I’ll break down the process into major parts: setting up the environment, mapping, navigation, and programming the robot.

Step 1: Environment Setup
Install ROS and Gazebo: Make sure you have ROS (Noetic or Melodic as per your OS) and the Gazebo simulator installed. You can find installation guides on the ROS installation page.
Install TurtleBot3 Packages: You'll need specific packages for the TurtleBot3 in Gazebo. Install them using the following commands:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-turtlebot3-gazebo
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-turtlebot3
Modify the TurtleBot3 Environment:
Navigate to the TurtleBot3 model file:
bash
Copy code
cd /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models/turtlebot3_plaza/
sudo gedit model.sdf
Modify the model.sdf file as per the assignment's instructions. Remember to make backups before making changes.
Step 2: Create a Map Using gmapping
Launch the Gazebo Simulation:
Start the TurtleBot3 simulation in the modified environment:
bash
Copy code
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
Mapping:
Launch the gmapping node to start mapping the environment:
bash
Copy code
roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping
Control the robot manually using:
bash
Copy code
roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
Move around to cover all areas and improve the map quality.
Save the Map:
Once you are satisfied with the map, save it using:
bash
Copy code
rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map
Step 3: Navigation Setup
Set Up the Navigation Stack:
Launch the navigation stack with your map:
bash
Copy code
roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=~/map.yaml
Initial Pose and Navigation:
Set the initial pose in the RViz GUI or via the command line.
Use the 2D Nav Goal in RViz to send target positions and orientations to the robot.
Step 4: Automate Task with Python and ROS smach
Python Script Setup:
